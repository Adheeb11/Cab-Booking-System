# 🚕 Fix: No Cabs Available Issue

## Problem

**Error:** "No cabs available at the moment"

**Cause:** All cabs are marked as `is_available = false` after previous bookings. The system marks cabs as unavailable when they're assigned to bookings, but doesn't automatically reset them.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Added Reset Endpoint**

Created new admin endpoint: `POST /api/admin/cabs/reset-availability`

**Location:** `backend/src/main/java/com/cabsystem/controller/AdminController.java`

**What it does:**

- Fetches all cabs from database
- Sets `isAvailable = true` for all cabs
- Saves changes
- Returns success message with count

### **2. Created Reset Tool**

Created `reset-cabs.html` - A simple web page to call the reset endpoint

---

## 🔧 How to Use

### **Option 1: Use the HTML Tool (Easiest)**

1. **Make sure backend is running** on `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Open the reset tool:**

   - Go to: `c:\projects\Oops\Cab-Booking-System\reset-cabs.html`
   - Or double-click the file to open in browser

3. **Click the button:** "Reset All Cabs to Available"

4. **Wait for confirmation:** "✅ Success! 6 cabs have been reset"

5. **Try booking again!**

---

### **Option 2: Use Postman/cURL**

```bash
# Using cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/cabs/reset-availability

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All cabs reset to available",
  "cabsReset": 6
}
```

---

### **Option 3: Direct SQL (If backend not running)**

```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres -d cab_booking_db

-- Reset all cabs
UPDATE cabs SET is_available = true;

-- Verify
SELECT cab_id, cab_number, is_available FROM cabs;
```

---

## 🎯 Testing After Reset

1. **Reset cabs** using any option above

2. **Go to booking page:** `http://localhost:3000/book-ride`

3. **Create booking:**

   - Pickup: "Connaught Place, Delhi"
   - Drop: "India Gate, Delhi"
   - Payment: Cash
   - Submit

4. **Expected result:** ✅ Booking created successfully!

---

## 🔄 Why This Happens

### **Booking Flow:**

```
1. User creates booking
2. System finds available cab
3. Assigns cab to booking
4. Marks cab as unavailable (is_available = false)
5. Booking completes
```

### **Issue:**

- Cabs don't automatically become available again after booking completes
- After 6 bookings, all cabs are unavailable
- New bookings fail with "No cabs available"

### **Solution:**

- Reset cabs manually using the tool
- **Future Enhancement:** Auto-reset cabs after booking completion or add "Complete Booking" feature

## 📊 Current Database State

To check cab status at any time:

```sql
SELECT
    cab_id,
    cab_number,
    cab_type,
    is_available,
    CASE WHEN is_available THEN '✅ Available' ELSE '❌ Unavailable' END as status
FROM cabs
ORDER BY cab_id;
```
